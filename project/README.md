## What's this? 
Inspired by one of the earliest arcade videogames, Pongsito introduces a game where two players use the paddles to hit a red ball back and forth on a black scren. The game keeps track of the score of P1 and P2, and stops when one player scores 100 points. 

## Sounds cool, what I have to do?
Before playing you should know how to install the game, and how to play it. 

### Installing
To install the game first you have to call
```
make
```
on './project`

Then, you call
```
make load
```
on `./project/shape-motion-demo`

### How to play
Using the switches (SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4) you control the pladdles of both players.
